I am a software developer with over fifteen years of professional experience
building software. I live in San Francisco. I currently work for
[Synthesis AI](https://synthesis.ai). In the past I have worked on networking in the Linux
kernel, built cross-platform desktop applications in Java and published an
Android [app](http://github.com/svrana/Viz) that was downloaded over 10M times
in its short lifetime.
