I am a software developer with over twenty years of professional experience
building software. I live in San Francisco. These days I feign productivity by tweaking my [init.lua](https://neovim.org) and
maintaining my home lab in [nix](https://nixos.org).

In the past I have worked on networking in the Linux kernel, built cross-platform desktop
applications in Java and published an Android [app](http://github.com/svrana/Viz) that was
downloaded over 10M times.
